# Soil-Erosion-Prediction-
Soil Erosion Prediction Using Machine Learning with advanced preprocessing (Earth System Science Data Dataset) 
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict soil erosion rates based on ESSD dataset. Using models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, the system identifies patterns in soil characteristics and environmental factors to estimate erosion risks. The project contributes to sustainable land management practices by providing data-driven insights into soil degradation and conservation strategies.
